# Economic Load Dispatch 

The power plants in a practical power system have varied fuel costs and are not all situated at the same distance from the center of loads. 
Additionally, the generation capacity exceeds the total load demand and losses under normal operating conditions. 
Consequently, scheduling generation has a wide range of alternatives. Hence, Economic Load Dispatch comes into role.
For an interconnected  power system to function effectively and dependably, sufficient analysis and understanding of its financial management are necessary.





## Solution

- The study of economic load dispatch makes it possible to operate power systems effectively and economically, guaranteeing a steady supply of electricity. 
- The ELD problem involves minimizing the total generation cost while satisfying a set of equality and inequality constraints related to power balance, generator limits, and transmission network limitations.
- ELD problem can be solved via traditional techniques like Lambda-Iterative , Newton-Raphson Method, Gradient method, etc.


In this research paper, we have used Lagrangian Multiplier and Machine Learning Algorithm for ELD problem.
